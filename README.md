## Challenge1
### Pracitce 3 basic concept for image
1. Rendering 3D object for rendering based 6D Pose tracking pipeline
* Rendering based 6D Pose tracking
* Using Pyrender
* Deal with unknown coordinate orientation
* Conversion between different coordinate system

2. Augmented Reality for Outside In tracking setup
* Camera calibration
* Coordinate conversion
3. Self supervised learning loss via warping
* Warping the image using Depth and Relative pose
* Differentiable bilinear interpolation
